Professional Summary: 
I'm a Generalist PM over 6 years of experience across various facets of Product Management. My diverse background as a Software Engineer, Program Manager, Qualitative Market Researcher, Project Manager, NPS Analyst, and Product Owner has given me a unique perspective on how organizations work. I excel at both paying attention to the details and keeping track of the big picture.

- My roles have taught me the importance of empathy, both for customers and the business. I've found that sincerity and persistence are key to solving tough problems. I believe that perfection is a journey, not a destination, and that a design process is only as strong as the values of the team members.

- I thrive in challenging environments that push me out of my comfort zone. I'm not afraid to be the dumbest person in the room, because I know that it will drive me to grow and improve.
