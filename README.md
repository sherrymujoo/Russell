Russell
Russell is a simple AI personal hiring assistant designed to streamline the hiring process, making it efficient and user-friendly for hiring managers, recruiters, and candidates alike.

***Description***
In today's fast-paced hiring landscape, Russell aims to bridge the gap between candidates and recruiters by providing an intuitive interface to gather and present relevant information. With Russell, you can:

Inquire About Experience: Ask questions about a candidate's previous experience, past employers, and total years in the industry.
Engage Directly: Book calls with candidates or request to view their work samples.
Deep Dive into Achievements: Request a summary of achievements, a list of skills, educational background, and much more.
This project was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor, and I've learned immensely from it. I invite you to explore Russell and provide your valuable feedback.

***Usage***
To get started with Russell:

Russell works only on Replit atm, atleast I was only able to make it work there. You just need to upload the app.py and home2.html files there and hit
