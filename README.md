Russell
Russell is a simple AI personal hiring assistant designed to streamline the hiring process, making it efficient and user-friendly for hiring managers, recruiters, and candidates alike.

***Description***
In today's fast-paced hiring landscape, Russell aims to bridge the gap between candidates and recruiters by providing an intuitive interface to gather and present relevant information. With Russell, you can:

Inquire About Experience: Ask questions about a candidate's previous experience, past employers, and total years in the industry.
Engage Directly: Book calls with candidates or request to view their work samples.
Deep Dive into Achievements: Request a summary of achievements, a list of skills, educational background, and much more.
This project was a challenging yet rewarding endeavor, and I've learned immensely from it. I invite you to explore Russell and provide your valuable feedback.

***USAGE INSTRUCTIONS***
To get started with Russell:

Russell works only on Replit atm, atleast I was only able to make it work there. You just need to upload the app.py and home2.html files there 

1. Main code resides in app.py and home2.html
2. requirements.txt needs to go into the packager files section
3. There may be issues with the default config files in replit. You may use the config file I've uploaded above. 

For any queries, issues, or feedback, please contact:
